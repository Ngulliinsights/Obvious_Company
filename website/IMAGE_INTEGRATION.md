### JavaScript Enhancements

### Performance Considerations
- Used WebP format for better compression
- Implemented lazy loading for non-critical images
- Added proper alt text for accessibility
- Optimized image sizes for different contexts

## Usage Guidelines

### Adding New Images
1. Place images in `website/images/` directory
2. Use WebP format when possible for better performance
3. Include descriptive alt text for accessibility
4. Consider image context and brand alignment

### Image Sizing
- **Hero backgrounds**: Full viewport width, optimized for cover
- **Content images**: Responsive sizing with max-width: 100%
- **Thumbnail images**: Fixed dimensions with object-fit: cover
- **Icon images**: Small circular images for subtle enhancement

### Accessibility
- All images include descriptive alt text
- Decorative images use empty alt attributes
- Images don't convey critical information without text alternatives
- Color contrast maintained for text over images

## Brand Alignment
All selected images align with The Obvious Company's brand values:
- Professional and sophisticated aesthetic
- Strategic thinking and leadership themes
- Technology and innovation focus
- Clean, modern visual style
- Subtle enhancement rather than distraction

## Future Enhancements
