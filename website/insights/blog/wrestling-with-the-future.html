            Why I'm learning to be wrong about artificial intelligence—and why
            you might need to as well
          </p>

          <p>
            I've been staring at my laptop screen for twenty minutes, watching
            the cursor blink in an empty document, wrestling with a realization
            that makes me deeply uncomfortable: I might be wrong about
            artificial intelligence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not wrong in the way we're usually wrong about
            technology—underestimating its impact or overestimating its
            timeline. Wrong in a more fundamental way. Wrong about what it means
            to be cautious. Wrong about what constitutes wisdom in the face of
            uncertainty. Wrong about the relationship between understanding
            something and engaging with it.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is the kind of wrong that keeps you awake at night, because it
            forces you to question not just your conclusions but the entire
            framework you've used to reach them.

            The Uncomfortable Truth About Being Smart
          </h2>

          <p>
            Here's what I've discovered about intelligent people and new
            technologies: we're often our own worst enemies. We see the problems
            with devastating clarity. We understand the second-order effects,
            the potential for misuse, the ways things could go sideways. We can
            articulate concerns with precision that would make a philosopher
            proud.
          </p>

          <p>
            Take my relationship with social media over the past decade. I saw
            the privacy implications early. I understood how algorithmic feeds
            could create echo chambers. I recognized the psychological
            manipulation inherent in engagement-driven design. I was, in many
            ways, completely right about these dangers.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was also completely wrong about what this understanding should
            lead me to do.
          </p>

          <p>
            While I spent years crafting thoughtful critiques of social media's
            impact on democracy and mental health, something else was happening.
            The world was reorganizing itself around these platforms. Businesses
            were building customer relationships through Instagram. Communities
            were forming around shared interests on Reddit. Political movements
            were gaining momentum through Twitter. Professional networks were
            solidifying on LinkedIn.
          </p>

          <p>
            My sophisticated understanding of social media's problems had led me
            to minimize my participation just as participation was becoming
            essential for professional and social connection. I had confused
            understanding the game with being above the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            This realization haunts me because I suspect I'm making the same
            mistake with artificial intelligence.
          </p>

            The Paralysis of Insight
          </h2>

          <p>
            There's a particular kind of intellectual trap that catches
            thoughtful people: the more deeply we understand something, the more
            we can see everything that could go wrong with it. This isn't
            necessarily bad—someone should be thinking about unintended
            consequences, ethical implications, and systemic risks. But when our
            ability to see problems becomes an excuse for inaction, insight
            transforms into paralysis.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've watched this happen with AI adoption in ways that feel
            painfully familiar. The marketing director who won't experiment with
            AI-generated content because she understands how it could homogenize
            brand voices. The analyst who avoids AI research tools because he's
            concerned about algorithmic bias. The writer who refuses to try AI
            writing assistants because she grasps the implications for human
            creativity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each of these positions is intellectually defensible. Each reflects
            genuine understanding of real risks. Each also represents a choice
            to remain on the sidelines while others establish new baselines for
            what constitutes competent work in these fields.
          </p>

          <p>
            I find myself asking an uncomfortable question: When does careful
            analysis become elaborate rationalization for avoiding uncertainty?
          </p>

            The Social Media Lesson I'm Still Learning
          </h2>

          <p>
            Let me be honest about my social media journey, because I think it
            illuminates something important about how smart people can be
            strategically stupid about technology adoption.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2008, I understood that Facebook was designed to be addictive. I
            recognized that "free" platforms were monetizing user attention and
            personal data. I could see how social networks might fragment shared
            reality and amplify extreme voices. These insights felt like wisdom.
          </p>

          <p>
            By 2012, I was proud of my minimal social media presence. I posted
            occasionally, checked feeds rarely, and maintained what I believed
            was a healthy distance from digital manipulation. I felt
            intellectually superior to friends who seemed enslaved by
            notifications and engagement metrics.
          </p>

          <p>
            By 2016, I realized I had a problem. Professional opportunities were
            increasingly flowing through networks I wasn't part of.
            Conversations that shaped my field were happening in spaces I rarely
            visited. Clients expected social proof of expertise that I hadn't
            bothered to establish. My principled stance was becoming
            professionally limiting.
          </p>

          <p>
            The painful truth was that my understanding of social media's
            problems was accurate but incomplete. I had focused so intensely on
            the risks that I had underestimated the costs of non-participation.
            I had treated engagement as binary—either you were manipulated by
            these platforms or you stayed away—when the real skill was learning
            to engage strategically.
          </p>

          <p>
            This experience taught me something unsettling about the
            relationship between intelligence and adaptation: being right about
            problems doesn't automatically make you right about solutions.

            The Humility of Not Knowing
          </h2>

          <p>
            The hardest part of writing about artificial intelligence is
            acknowledging how much I don't know. Not just about the technology
            itself—though that uncertainty is vast—but about what our engagement
            with it should look like.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't know whether widespread AI adoption will ultimately prove
            democratizing or concentrating in its effects on economic
            opportunity. I don't know whether AI assistance will enhance human
            creativity or diminish it. I don't know whether the productivity
            gains will be distributed broadly or captured by those who already
            hold advantages.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't even know whether my current experiments with AI tools are
            helping or hurting my own thinking and writing processes.
          </p>

          <p>
            This uncertainty feels different from the kind I'm used to as a
            writer and thinker. Usually, I can research my way toward reasonable
            confidence about complex topics. I can find experts, examine
            evidence, and develop informed positions. With AI, I feel like I'm
            trying to analyze a movie while it's still being filmed, with the
            plot changing based on how audiences react to early scenes.
          </p>

          <p>
            But here's what I'm learning: not knowing doesn't mean not engaging.
            In fact, it might be precisely because the implications are unclear
            that engagement becomes more important, not less.
          </p>

          <h2

            The Experiment of Cautious Participation
          </h2>

          <p>
            Over the past six months, I've been conducting what I call an
            experiment in cautious participation with AI tools. Not diving
            headfirst into every new application, but not avoiding them entirely
            either. Instead, I'm trying to develop what feels like a more mature
            relationship with technological uncertainty.
          </p>

          <p>
            This means using AI writing assistants for brainstorming while being
            alert to how they might be affecting my own creative processes. It
            means experimenting with AI research tools while maintaining
            skepticism about their outputs. It means trying AI-generated
            analysis while double-checking conclusions through traditional
            methods.
          </p>

          <p>
            What I'm discovering surprises me. The technology is simultaneously
            more powerful and more limited than I expected. More useful for
            certain tasks and more problematic for others. More transformative
            of work processes and more dependent on human judgment than early
            descriptions suggested.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most importantly, I'm learning that meaningful evaluation of AI
            requires sustained engagement, not theoretical analysis from a
            distance. The risks and benefits become clear only through practice,
            experimentation, and yes, occasional failure.
          </p>

          <p>
            This feels uncomfortably similar to learning to drive. You can study
            traffic laws and understand accident statistics, but until you're
            actually navigating real roads with other drivers, your knowledge
            remains abstract. The skills that matter—judgment, timing,
            situational awareness—develop through experience, not analysis.
          </p>

            The False Comfort of Principles
          </h2>

          <p>
            I've spent much of my career believing that having clear principles
            about technology was a form of wisdom. Don't use platforms that
            commodify personal data. Don't engage with systems designed to
            manipulate attention. Don't participate in technologies that might
            displace human workers.
          </p>

          <p>
            These principles felt like moral clarity in an ethically ambiguous
            landscape. They provided simple decision rules in complex
            situations. They offered the satisfaction of consistency in a world
            of rapid change.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I'm beginning to suspect that rigid principles about emerging
            technologies might be less like moral guideposts and more like
            intellectual security blankets—comforting but ultimately limiting.
          </p>

          <p>
            The world doesn't organize itself around our principles. While I was
            maintaining consistent positions about social media and data
            privacy, entire industries were reorganizing around these platforms.
            While I was articulating concerns about AI and human displacement,
            others were learning to work alongside artificial intelligence in
            ways that enhanced rather than threatened their capabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            This doesn't mean principles are worthless. It means they need to be
            more flexible, more responsive to emerging evidence, more willing to
            evolve as understanding deepens.

            What I'm Learning to Do Differently
          </h2>

          <p>
            Instead of asking "Is this technology good or bad?" I'm trying to
            ask "How can I engage with this technology in ways that align with
            my values while remaining professionally viable?"
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of seeking perfect understanding before engagement, I'm
            accepting that understanding might only come through careful
            experimentation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of treating technological adoption as a moral statement, I'm
            approaching it as a practical skill that requires development over
            time.
          </p>

          <p>
            This shift feels both liberating and terrifying. Liberating because
            it removes the pressure to have definitive answers about inherently
            uncertain situations. Terrifying because it requires constant
            judgment calls about risks and benefits that can only be evaluated
            retrospectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most challengingly, it requires admitting that my sophisticated
            understanding of technological risks might be incomplete without
            equally sophisticated understanding of technological
            opportunities—and that this understanding might only come through
            participation.
          </p>

            The Question That Keeps Me Awake
          </h2>

          <p>
            Here's what bothers me most about our current moment with artificial
            intelligence: I suspect the people best equipped to use these tools
            responsibly are the same people most likely to avoid them entirely.
          </p>

          <p>
            The marketing professional who understands bias in algorithmic
            systems would be excellent at crafting AI-generated content that
            avoids stereotypes and maintains authentic brand voice. But her
            understanding of the problems might keep her from developing the
            skills to do this well.
          </p>

          <p>
            The researcher who grasps the limitations of AI analysis would be
            ideally positioned to use these tools while maintaining appropriate
            skepticism about their outputs. But his awareness of these
            limitations might prevent him from exploring how AI could enhance
            rather than replace traditional research methods.
          </p>

          <p>
            The writer who comprehends the implications of AI for human
            creativity would be perfectly suited to experiment with AI
            assistance in ways that augment rather than substitute for human
            insight. But her concerns about these implications might lead her to
            avoid experimentation entirely.
          </p>

          <p>
            This feels like a tragic waste of exactly the kind of thoughtful,
            critical intelligence that emerging technologies most need.
          </p>

            Learning to Be Wrong Together
          </h2>

          <p>
            Writing this piece has been an exercise in intellectual
            vulnerability. I'm essentially arguing that some of my most
            carefully reasoned positions about technology might be strategically
            counterproductive. That my sophisticated understanding of problems
            might be creating new problems. That the wisdom I've accumulated
            about previous technological transitions might be inadequate for
            current challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            This isn't comfortable. It requires admitting that intelligence and
            good judgment don't automatically lead to optimal strategies for
            navigating technological change. That being right about risks
            doesn't necessarily make you right about responses to those risks.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I'm learning that discomfort might be exactly what thoughtful
            engagement with uncertain situations requires. Not the discomfort of
            reckless experimentation, but the discomfort of measured
            participation despite incomplete understanding.
          </p>

          <p>
            The alternative—waiting for certainty before engagement—feels
            increasingly like a luxury we can't afford. While we're developing
            perfect analyses of imperfect technologies, others are developing
            imperfect competencies with transformative tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perhaps the real wisdom lies not in avoiding uncertainty but in
            learning to navigate it skillfully, with both confidence and
            humility, both critical thinking and practical experimentation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perhaps the question isn't whether artificial intelligence will
            transform how we work and think—it already is. The question is
            whether those of us who understand its limitations best will find
            ways to engage with its possibilities, or whether we'll continue to
            watch from the sidelines, armed with sophisticated critiques and
            increasingly irrelevant insights.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't know the answer to that question yet. But I'm no longer
            willing to let my uncertainty about the destination prevent me from
            taking the first steps of the journey.
