# Wrestling with the Future: A Confession About Technology and Uncertainty

*Why I'm learning to be wrong about artificial intelligence—and why you might need to as well*

---

I've been staring at my laptop screen for twenty minutes, watching the cursor blink in an empty document, wrestling with a realization that makes me deeply uncomfortable: I might be wrong about artificial intelligence.

Not wrong in the way we're usually wrong about technology—underestimating its impact or overestimating its timeline. Wrong in a more fundamental way. Wrong about what it means to be cautious. Wrong about what constitutes wisdom in the face of uncertainty. Wrong about the relationship between understanding something and engaging with it.

This is the kind of wrong that keeps you awake at night, because it forces you to question not just your conclusions but the entire framework you've used to reach them.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Being Smart

Here's what I've discovered about intelligent people and new technologies: we're often our own worst enemies. We see the problems with devastating clarity. We understand the second-order effects, the potential for misuse, the ways things could go sideways. We can articulate concerns with precision that would make a philosopher proud.

Take my relationship with social media over the past decade. I saw the privacy implications early. I understood how algorithmic feeds could create echo chambers. I recognized the psychological manipulation inherent in engagement-driven design. I was, in many ways, completely right about these dangers.

I was also completely wrong about what this understanding should lead me to do.

While I spent years crafting thoughtful critiques of social media's impact on democracy and mental health, something else was happening. The world was reorganizing itself around these platforms. Businesses were building customer relationships through Instagram. Communities were forming around shared interests on Reddit. Political movements were gaining momentum through Twitter. Professional networks were solidifying on LinkedIn.

My sophisticated understanding of social media's problems had led me to minimize my participation just as participation was becoming essential for professional and social connection. I had confused understanding the game with being above the game.

This realization haunts me because I suspect I'm making the same mistake with artificial intelligence.

## The Paralysis of Insight

There's a particular kind of intellectual trap that catches thoughtful people: the more deeply we understand something, the more we can see everything that could go wrong with it. This isn't necessarily bad—someone should be thinking about unintended consequences, ethical implications, and systemic risks. But when our ability to see problems becomes an excuse for inaction, insight transforms into paralysis.

I've watched this happen with AI adoption in ways that feel painfully familiar. The marketing director who won't experiment with AI-generated content because she understands how it could homogenize brand voices. The analyst who avoids AI research tools because he's concerned about algorithmic bias. The writer who refuses to try AI writing assistants because she grasps the implications for human creativity.

Each of these positions is intellectually defensible. Each reflects genuine understanding of real risks. Each also represents a choice to remain on the sidelines while others establish new baselines for what constitutes competent work in these fields.

I find myself asking an uncomfortable question: When does careful analysis become elaborate rationalization for avoiding uncertainty?

## The Social Media Lesson I'm Still Learning

Let me be honest about my social media journey, because I think it illuminates something important about how smart people can be strategically stupid about technology adoption.

In 2008, I understood that Facebook was designed to be addictive. I recognized that "free" platforms were monetizing user attention and personal data. I could see how social networks might fragment shared reality and amplify extreme voices. These insights felt like wisdom.

By 2012, I was proud of my minimal social media presence. I posted occasionally, checked feeds rarely, and maintained what I believed was a healthy distance from digital manipulation. I felt intellectually superior to friends who seemed enslaved by notifications and engagement metrics.

By 2016, I realized I had a problem. Professional opportunities were increasingly flowing through networks I wasn't part of. Conversations that shaped my field were happening in spaces I rarely visited. Clients expected social proof of expertise that I hadn't bothered to establish. My principled stance was becoming professionally limiting.

The painful truth was that my understanding of social media's problems was accurate but incomplete. I had focused so intensely on the risks that I had underestimated the costs of non-participation. I had treated engagement as binary—either you were manipulated by these platforms or you stayed away—when the real skill was learning to engage strategically.

This experience taught me something unsettling about the relationship between intelligence and adaptation: being right about problems doesn't automatically make you right about solutions.

## The Humility of Not Knowing

The hardest part of writing about artificial intelligence is acknowledging how much I don't know. Not just about the technology itself—though that uncertainty is vast—but about what our engagement with it should look like.

I don't know whether widespread AI adoption will ultimately prove democratizing or concentrating in its effects on economic opportunity. I don't know whether AI assistance will enhance human creativity or diminish it. I don't know whether the productivity gains will be distributed broadly or captured by those who already hold advantages.

I don't even know whether my current experiments with AI tools are helping or hurting my own thinking and writing processes.

This uncertainty feels different from the kind I'm used to as a writer and thinker. Usually, I can research my way toward reasonable confidence about complex topics. I can find experts, examine evidence, and develop informed positions. With AI, I feel like I'm trying to analyze a movie while it's still being filmed, with the plot changing based on how audiences react to early scenes.

But here's what I'm learning: not knowing doesn't mean not engaging. In fact, it might be precisely because the implications are unclear that engagement becomes more important, not less.

## The Experiment of Cautious Participation

Over the past six months, I've been conducting what I call an experiment in cautious participation with AI tools. Not diving headfirst into every new application, but not avoiding them entirely either. Instead, I'm trying to develop what feels like a more mature relationship with technological uncertainty.

This means using AI writing assistants for brainstorming while being alert to how they might be affecting my own creative processes. It means experimenting with AI research tools while maintaining skepticism about their outputs. It means trying AI-generated analysis while double-checking conclusions through traditional methods.

What I'm discovering surprises me. The technology is simultaneously more powerful and more limited than I expected. More useful for certain tasks and more problematic for others. More transformative of work processes and more dependent on human judgment than early descriptions suggested.

Most importantly, I'm learning that meaningful evaluation of AI requires sustained engagement, not theoretical analysis from a distance. The risks and benefits become clear only through practice, experimentation, and yes, occasional failure.

This feels uncomfortably similar to learning to drive. You can study traffic laws and understand accident statistics, but until you're actually navigating real roads with other drivers, your knowledge remains abstract. The skills that matter—judgment, timing, situational awareness—develop through experience, not analysis.

## The False Comfort of Principles

I've spent much of my career believing that having clear principles about technology was a form of wisdom. Don't use platforms that commodify personal data. Don't engage with systems designed to manipulate attention. Don't participate in technologies that might displace human workers.

These principles felt like moral clarity in an ethically ambiguous landscape. They provided simple decision rules in complex situations. They offered the satisfaction of consistency in a world of rapid change.

But I'm beginning to suspect that rigid principles about emerging technologies might be less like moral guideposts and more like intellectual security blankets—comforting but ultimately limiting.

The world doesn't organize itself around our principles. While I was maintaining consistent positions about social media and data privacy, entire industries were reorganizing around these platforms. While I was articulating concerns about AI and human displacement, others were learning to work alongside artificial intelligence in ways that enhanced rather than threatened their capabilities.

This doesn't mean principles are worthless. It means they need to be more flexible, more responsive to emerging evidence, more willing to evolve as understanding deepens.

## What I'm Learning to Do Differently

Instead of asking "Is this technology good or bad?" I'm trying to ask "How can I engage with this technology in ways that align with my values while remaining professionally viable?"

Instead of seeking perfect understanding before engagement, I'm accepting that understanding might only come through careful experimentation.

Instead of treating technological adoption as a moral statement, I'm approaching it as a practical skill that requires development over time.

This shift feels both liberating and terrifying. Liberating because it removes the pressure to have definitive answers about inherently uncertain situations. Terrifying because it requires constant judgment calls about risks and benefits that can only be evaluated retrospectively.

Most challengingly, it requires admitting that my sophisticated understanding of technological risks might be incomplete without equally sophisticated understanding of technological opportunities—and that this understanding might only come through participation.

## The Question That Keeps Me Awake

Here's what bothers me most about our current moment with artificial intelligence: I suspect the people best equipped to use these tools responsibly are the same people most likely to avoid them entirely.

The marketing professional who understands bias in algorithmic systems would be excellent at crafting AI-generated content that avoids stereotypes and maintains authentic brand voice. But her understanding of the problems might keep her from developing the skills to do this well.

The researcher who grasps the limitations of AI analysis would be ideally positioned to use these tools while maintaining appropriate skepticism about their outputs. But his awareness of these limitations might prevent him from exploring how AI could enhance rather than replace traditional research methods.

The writer who comprehends the implications of AI for human creativity would be perfectly suited to experiment with AI assistance in ways that augment rather than substitute for human insight. But her concerns about these implications might lead her to avoid experimentation entirely.

This feels like a tragic waste of exactly the kind of thoughtful, critical intelligence that emerging technologies most need.

## Learning to Be Wrong Together

Writing this piece has been an exercise in intellectual vulnerability. I'm essentially arguing that some of my most carefully reasoned positions about technology might be strategically counterproductive. That my sophisticated understanding of problems might be creating new problems. That the wisdom I've accumulated about previous technological transitions might be inadequate for current challenges.

This isn't comfortable. It requires admitting that intelligence and good judgment don't automatically lead to optimal strategies for navigating technological change. That being right about risks doesn't necessarily make you right about responses to those risks.

But I'm learning that discomfort might be exactly what thoughtful engagement with uncertain situations requires. Not the discomfort of reckless experimentation, but the discomfort of measured participation despite incomplete understanding.

The alternative—waiting for certainty before engagement—feels increasingly like a luxury we can't afford. While we're developing perfect analyses of imperfect technologies, others are developing imperfect competencies with transformative tools.

Perhaps the real wisdom lies not in avoiding uncertainty but in learning to navigate it skillfully, with both confidence and humility, both critical thinking and practical experimentation.

Perhaps the question isn't whether artificial intelligence will transform how we work and think—it already is. The question is whether those of us who understand its limitations best will find ways to engage with its possibilities, or whether we'll continue to watch from the sidelines, armed with sophisticated critiques and increasingly irrelevant insights.

I don't know the answer to that question yet. But I'm no longer willing to let my uncertainty about the destination prevent me from taking the first steps of the journey.
