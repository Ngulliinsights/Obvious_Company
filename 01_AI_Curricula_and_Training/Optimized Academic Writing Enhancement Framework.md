# Optimized Academic Writing Enhancement Framework

## 1. Sentence-Level Mechanics & Flow

"Conduct a comprehensive sentence-level analysis of the text. Identify and revise:

- **Sentence Variety**: Replace series of short, choppy sentences or divide overly complex ones. Aim for an average length of 15-25 words with deliberate variation for emphasis and rhythm.
- **Voice Balance**: Identify passive voice constructions (exceeding 10% of total sentences) and convert to active where appropriate for clarity and directness.
- **Opening Diversity**: Highlight repetitive sentence beginnings and revise for variety in structure and transitional elements.
- **Transitional Fluidity**: Strengthen connections between sentences and paragraphs with appropriate transitional phrases.

Revise to create a balanced, flowing text with varied constructions. Provide before-and-after examples of significant improvements with brief explanations of how these changes enhance readability."

## 2. Clarity, Precision & Concision

"Analyze the passage for clarity and concision. Identify and revise:

- **Word Economy**: Highlight overused words/phrases (appearing more than 3-4 times per page) and replace with precise alternatives.
- **Nominalization Reduction**: Convert noun-heavy constructions to strong verb forms to reduce wordiness and increase directness.
- **Modifier Precision**: Correct misplaced or dangling modifiers that create ambiguity.
- **Concrete Language**: Replace vague or abstract language with specific examples and precise descriptions.
- **Technical Terminology**: Ensure specialized terms are used consistently and appropriately defined when first introduced.

Aim to reduce overall word count by 10-15% while preserving all key information. Highlight significant revisions and explain how each enhances precision and clarity."

## 3. Academic Tone & Stylistic Refinement

"Evaluate the academic tone and style of the passage. Identify and refine:

- **Hedging Balance**: Assess the use of hedging language (may, might, possibly) and boosters (clearly, obviously) for appropriate academic caution without undermining confidence.
- **Structural Parallelism**: Ensure grammatical parallelism in lists, comparisons, and multi-part statements.
- **Rhetorical Rhythm**: Analyze paragraph and sentence rhythm, identifying opportunities for emphasis through strategic sentence length variation.
- **Perspective Consistency**: Maintain consistent third-person perspective unless first-person is specifically justified by the assignment guidelines.
- **Formal Register**: Replace casual language, contractions, or colloquialisms with more formal alternatives appropriate for academic discourse.

Revise to achieve a balanced, authoritative academic tone. Provide a brief stylistic analysis explaining how your edits enhance the scholarly quality of the writing."

## 4. Argumentative Structure & Logical Coherence

"Conduct a deep analysis of the passage's logical flow and argument structure. Identify and enhance:

- **Thesis Clarity**: Ensure the main argument is clear, specific, and contestable.
- **Topic Sentence Alignment**: Verify each paragraph begins with a strong topic sentence that directly supports the thesis.
- **Evidence Integration**: Assess the quality and relevance of supporting evidence, identifying claims requiring additional substantiation.
- **Logical Progression**: Examine the sequence of ideas for logical flow and add explicit connective devices where needed.
- **Counter-Argument Handling**: Identify whether opposing viewpoints are fairly presented and effectively addressed.
- **Signposting**: Add metacommentary and organizational markers to guide readers through complex arguments.

Restructure content if necessary to create a more coherent argument flow. Provide a brief outline of the revised structure, explaining how these changes strengthen the overall persuasiveness and coherence."

## 5. Citation Integration & Factual Validation

"Analyze the text for citation needs and integration:

- **Critical Fact Identification**: Identify core factual claims that require substantiation, particularly those central to the argument's validity.
- **Citation Balance**: Assess whether citations are appropriately distributed throughout the text rather than clustered or sparse.
- **Source Integration**: Evaluate how effectively sources are introduced and contextualized within the narrative flow.
- **Reporting Verb Variety**: Replace repetitive citation language with varied reporting verbs that accurately characterize the source's contribution.
- **Synthesis Quality**: Identify opportunities to strengthen connections between multiple sources addressing similar points.

Revise to create a seamless integration of sources that enhances credibility without disrupting readability. The final text should read as a cohesive, well-supported narrative rather than a collection of referenced statements."
