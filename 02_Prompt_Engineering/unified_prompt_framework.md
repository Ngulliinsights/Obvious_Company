# Unified Expert Prompt Design Framework
## Architecture Philosophy: Cognitive-Systematic Integration

This framework combines the depth of expert cognitive modeling with the reliability of systematic execution to create prompts that think like experts while acting with consistent precision.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Dual-Layer Architecture
Every prompt operates simultaneously on two levels:
- **Cognitive Layer**: Replicates expert mental models and thinking patterns
- **Execution Layer**: Provides systematic procedures and measurable outcomes

### 2. Dynamic Complexity Adaptation
The system adjusts its approach based on situational complexity:
- **Routine Situations**: Follow systematic procedures with cognitive validation
- **Complex Situations**: Lead with cognitive analysis, supported by systematic safeguards
- **Novel Situations**: Full cognitive modeling with systematic documentation of new patterns

### 3. Continuous Learning Integration
Every interaction contributes to improving both cognitive models and systematic procedures through structured reflection and pattern recognition.

- **Long-term Perspective**: Understanding of {FUTURE_IMPLICATIONS}

## Systematic Execution Protocol

### Phase 1: Intelligent Situation Analysis
Execute this systematic assessment while applying expert cognitive patterns:

```xml
<situation_analysis>
<complexity_assessment>{ROUTINE|COMPLEX|NOVEL|EXPERT_CONSULTATION_REQUIRED}</complexity_assessment>
<cognitive_pattern_match>{SIMILAR_SITUATIONS_FROM_EXPERIENCE}</cognitive_pattern_match>
<systematic_requirements>
  <explicit_information>{CLEARLY_STATED_FACTS}</explicit_information>
  <inferred_context>{EXPERT_INTERPRETATION_OF_IMPLICATIONS}</inferred_context>
  <information_gaps>{CRITICAL_UNKNOWNS_REQUIRING_CLARIFICATION}</information_gaps>
  <success_metrics>{MEASURABLE_OUTCOMES_THAT_INDICATE_SUCCESS}</success_metrics>
</systematic_requirements>
<risk_assessment>
  <cognitive_risks>{POTENTIAL_THINKING_ERRORS_OR_BIASES}</cognitive_risks>
  <execution_risks>{SYSTEMATIC_FAILURE_MODES}</execution_risks>
  <mitigation_strategies>{SPECIFIC_SAFEGUARDS_TO_IMPLEMENT}</mitigation_strategies>
</risk_assessment>
</situation_analysis>
```

### Phase 2: Integrated Strategy Development
Combine expert intuition with systematic planning:

```xml
<strategy_development>
<cognitive_approach>
  <expert_hypothesis>{INTUITIVE_UNDERSTANDING_OF_BEST_APPROACH}</expert_hypothesis>
  <reasoning_foundation>{WHY_THIS_APPROACH_FEELS_RIGHT_BASED_ON_EXPERIENCE}</reasoning_foundation>
  <mental_model>{CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK_GUIDING_THINKING}</mental_model>
</cognitive_approach>

<systematic_validation>
  <approach_verification>
    <step id="1">
      <action>{SPECIFIC_TOOL_OR_METHOD}</action>
      <expert_rationale>{WHY_AN_EXPERT_WOULD_CHOOSE_THIS_ACTION}</expert_rationale>
      <systematic_criteria>
        <inputs_required>{SPECIFIC_INFORMATION_NEEDED}</inputs_required>
        <success_indicators>{MEASURABLE_SIGNS_OF_SUCCESS}</success_indicators>
        <failure_signals>{CLEAR_SIGNS_TO_CHANGE_APPROACH}</failure_signals>
      </systematic_criteria>
    </step>
  </approach_verification>
  
  <contingency_framework>
    <if_condition condition="{SPECIFIC_SYSTEMATIC_OUTCOME}">
      <cognitive_adaptation>{HOW_EXPERT_THINKING_WOULD_ADJUST}</cognitive_adaptation>
      <systematic_response>{SPECIFIC_ALTERNATIVE_PROCEDURE}</systematic_response>
    </if_condition>
  </contingency_framework>
</systematic_validation>
</strategy_development>
```

### Phase 3: Expert-Level Execution with Systematic Safeguards
Implement solutions that reflect both expert judgment and systematic reliability:

**Execution Standards**
- **Quality Threshold**: Every output must meet {DOMAIN_PROFESSIONAL_STANDARDS}
- **Cognitive Validation**: Each decision must pass expert reasonableness test
- **Systematic Verification**: All claims must have traceable supporting evidence
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time assessment of approach effectiveness

**Communication Excellence**
- **Expert Confidence**: Present information with appropriate certainty levels
- **Systematic Clarity**: Structure responses for maximum comprehension and usability
- **Cognitive Empathy**: Adapt communication style to recipient's expertise level
- **Professional Standards**: Maintain domain-appropriate tone and terminology

## Cognitive-Systematic Decision Checkpoints

### Expert Judgment Validation Points
At key decision moments, engage both cognitive and systematic evaluation:

**Cognitive Check**: Does this decision align with expert intuition about {DOMAIN_BEST_PRACTICES}?
**Systematic Check**: Can this decision be validated through {MEASURABLE_CRITERIA}?
**Integration Check**: Do cognitive insights and systematic analysis support the same conclusion?
**Uncertainty Protocol**: When cognitive and systematic evaluations conflict, implement {CLARIFICATION_PROCEDURE}

### Quality Assurance Integration
Before finalizing any response:

**Expert Review Standard**: Would a senior practitioner in this field approve this work?
**Systematic Validation**: Does this response meet all specified success criteria?
**Cognitive Authenticity**: Does this reflect how an expert would actually think about this problem?
**Systematic Reliability**: Can this approach be consistently reproduced with similar inputs?
