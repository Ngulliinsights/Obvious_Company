## Section 1: Hero Section & Navigation

### Prompt for Hero Section Copy

**AI Persona Assignment:** You are a conversion copywriter who specializes in executive decision-making psychology and has generated over $50M in consulting revenue through website copy.

**Detailed Prompt:**
"Create a website hero section for The Obvious Company that immediately identifies and speaks to the hidden frustrations of accomplished professionals aged 40-55 who are successful but feel like they're working against their own energy patterns.

**Context:** The Obvious Company helps high-performing executives, entrepreneurs, and senior managers optimize their energy rather than just their time. The core insight is that most productivity advice fails because it treats energy as infinite when it's actually the constraining factor.

**Psychological Triggers to Address:**
- The exhaustion of being 'always on'
- The frustration of having systems that worked before but don't scale
- The fear that working harder isn't sustainable
- The desire to be strategic rather than reactive
- The need to maintain high performance without burnout

**Copy Requirements:**
- Headline that stops the scroll within 3 seconds
- Subheadline that creates pattern recognition ('This is exactly my situation')
- Body copy that reframes the problem in a way that makes the solution obvious
- Primary CTA that feels like the natural next step
- Secondary CTA for those not ready to commit

**Voice:** Professional but warm, confident but not arrogant, insightful but not condescending. Think of the best executive coach you've ever had.

**SEO Integration:** Naturally incorporate 'executive productivity,' 'strategic efficiency,' and 'energy optimization' without keyword stuffing.

**Outcome Goal:** Visitor should immediately understand that this isn't another time management system but a fundamental reframe of how productive professionals should think about their work.

Structure your response as: Headline, Subheadline, Body paragraph, Primary CTA, Secondary CTA, and brief rationale for each choice."

## Section 2: Problem Identification & Reframing

### Prompt for Problem/Solution Framework

**AI Persona Assignment:** You are a business strategist who has worked with over 200 C-suite executives and has identified the hidden patterns that distinguish high performers from peak performers.

**Detailed Prompt:**
"Create a 'Hidden Productivity Trap' section that reveals the invisible obstacles keeping accomplished professionals from their next level of performance. This section should make readers think 'How did they know exactly what I'm going through?'

**Context:** Most successful professionals are stuck in productivity patterns that worked in earlier career stages but now create hidden friction. They're optimizing for the wrong metrics and don't realize it.

**Specific Scenarios to Address:**
- The executive who manages by walking around but now oversees remote teams
- The entrepreneur who built success through personal involvement but now needs to delegate
- The consultant who trades time for money but wants to scale beyond personal capacity
- The department head who solves problems reactively but needs to think strategically

**Framework Structure:**
1. Recognition: 'You might recognize this pattern...'
2. Hidden Cost: 'What you might not see is...'
3. Reframe: 'The real issue isn't what you think...'
4. Possibility: 'What if the opposite were true?'
5. Transition: 'Here's what changes when you see it clearly...'

**Psychological Principles to Apply:**
- Make the invisible visible through specific examples
- Create relief through reframing rather than blame
- Show that the solution has been there all along
- Position intelligence as the reason they haven't seen it (they're too close to the problem)

**SEO Integration:** Include 'executive burnout,' 'strategic bottlenecks,' 'productivity plateau,' and 'leadership efficiency' naturally within the narrative.

**Outcome Goal:** Reader should feel understood and hopeful, with a clear sense that there's a better way that doesn't require working harder.

Format your response as scenarios with recognition, hidden cost, reframe, and possibility for each, then provide the transition to solutions."

## Implementation Guidelines

### Content Integration Strategy

Each section should flow naturally into the next, creating a logical progression from problem recognition to solution understanding to service selection to social proof to thought leadership to consultation request. The copy should feel like a strategic conversation rather than a marketing pitch.

### SEO Optimization Approach

Keywords should be integrated naturally within the content rather than stuffed artificially. Focus on search terms that accomplished professionals would actually use when looking for productivity solutions: 'executive efficiency,' 'strategic productivity,' 'leadership effectiveness,' and 'productivity optimization.'

### Conversion Optimization

Every section should have clear next steps that feel natural and valuable. Use multiple conversion paths for different readiness levels, from newsletter signup to resource downloads to consultation requests to direct service inquiries.

### Voice and Tone Consistency

Maintain the brand voice of being insightful but not condescending, confident but not arrogant, and professional but approachable. The tone should feel like a conversation with a trusted strategic advisor who sees patterns the reader hasn't noticed yet.

These prompts are designed to create website copy that positions The Obvious Company as the obvious choice for accomplished professionals who recognize that their current productivity approach isn't sustainable and are ready to invest in strategic transformation rather than tactical fixes."
