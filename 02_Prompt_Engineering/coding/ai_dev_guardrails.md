# AI Development Guardrails & Critical Thinking Prompts

## Foundation Building Guardrails

### The "Explain First" Protocol
Before implementing any AI-suggested code, use these prompts:

**Understanding Check:**
```
Before you provide the implementation, explain:
1. What problem this code solves and why this approach was chosen
2. What each major component does and how they interact
3. What could go wrong with this approach and how we'd debug it
4. What alternatives exist and why this one is optimal
5. How this fits into the broader system architecture
```

**Assumption Validation:**
```
Stop and verify: What assumptions are you making about:
- The existing codebase structure?
- User requirements that aren't explicitly stated?
- Performance constraints and scalability needs?
- Security implications?
- Future maintenance requirements?

List these assumptions explicitly before proceeding.
```

### The "Build Understanding" Framework

**Concept Mapping:**
```
Before generating code, create a concept map showing:
- Input: What data/events trigger this functionality?
- Process: What transformations happen step by step?
- Output: What results are produced and where do they go?
- Dependencies: What external systems, libraries, or data does this rely on?
- Side effects: What else in the system might be affected?
```

**Mental Model Building:**
```
Explain this implementation as if teaching a junior developer:
- What mental model should they build to understand this code?
- What analogies or real-world comparisons help explain the concepts?
- What are the most common misconceptions about this approach?
- How would you walk through debugging this if it breaks?
```

## Critical Thinking Enforcement

### The "Challenge Protocol"
```
Before accepting any AI suggestion, ask:
1. "What edge cases hasn't this considered?"
2. "How would this perform under 10x the expected load?"
3. "What happens when the external API this depends on is down?"
4. "How would a malicious user try to exploit this?"
5. "What would make this code impossible to maintain in 2 years?"
```

### The "Alternative Paths" Exercise
```
Generate 3 different approaches to solve this problem:
1. The "simple but limited" approach
2. The "robust but complex" approach  
3. The "creative/unconventional" approach

For each approach, explain:
- What tradeoffs it makes
- When you'd choose this approach over others
- What you'd need to add later to make it production-ready
```

### The "Failure Analysis" Method
```
For every implementation, predict:
1. The 3 most likely ways this code will fail
2. How you'd detect each failure mode
3. What the user experience would be during each failure
4. How you'd gracefully handle or recover from each scenario
5. What monitoring/logging you'd add to catch issues early
```

## Experience-Building Progressions

### The "Scaffolded Learning" Approach
```
Structure AI assistance in learning layers:

Layer 1 - Pattern Recognition:
"Show me the common patterns in [framework/language] for handling [specific task]. 
Don't implement yet - just show me the patterns and explain when to use each."

Layer 2 - Guided Implementation:
"Now help me implement [specific pattern] step by step. At each step, explain 
why we're making this choice and what would happen if we did it differently."

Layer 3 - Independent Problem Solving:
"I want to implement [feature]. Don't give me the code - instead, help me break 
down the problem, identify the patterns I should use, and guide me through my 
implementation with questions and feedback."
```

### The "Depth-First" Method
```
Instead of implementing multiple features, pick one feature and explore it deeply:

"Let's implement [single feature] together, but I want to understand:
- 5 different ways to implement this
- The performance implications of each approach
- How to test each implementation thoroughly
- How to make it maintainable and extensible
- How it would integrate with common architectures
- What industry best practices apply here"
```

## Technology Leverage Without Dependency

### The "Collaborative Reasoning" Framework
```
Structure AI interactions as collaborative problem-solving:

"I'm thinking about implementing [feature] using [approach]. 
Let's reason through this together:
- What do you think about my approach?
- What problems do you foresee?
- What would you do differently and why?
- What questions should I be asking that I'm not?
- What would an expert in this domain want me to consider?"
```

### The "Teaching Exchange" Method
```
Alternate between learning and teaching:

Learning Phase:
"Explain [concept] to me like I'm learning it for the first time."

Teaching Phase:
"I'm going to implement this feature and explain my reasoning. 
Stop me when I make assumptions, skip steps, or miss important considerations."

Validation Phase:
"Now help me stress-test my understanding by asking me hard questions 
about edge cases, performance, and maintenance."
```

## Workflow Integration

### The "Competence Gate" System
Before moving to implementation, developers must demonstrate understanding by:

1. **Explaining the Problem Space:**
   - Articulate the business problem being solved
   - Identify the technical constraints and requirements
   - Map out the stakeholders and their needs

2. **Designing the Solution:**
   - Sketch the high-level architecture
   - Identify the key components and their interactions
   - Choose appropriate patterns and justify the choices

3. **Predicting Challenges:**
   - Anticipate integration points and potential conflicts
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Consider performance and scalability implications

4. **Planning for Maintenance:**
   - Design for testability and debuggability
   - Consider how the code will evolve over time
   - Plan documentation and knowledge transfer

### The "Reflection Protocol"
After each implementation session:

```
Reflection Questions:
1. What did I learn about the problem domain?
2. What patterns or principles did I apply?
3. What surprised me during implementation?
4. What would I do differently next time?
5. What questions do I still have?
6. How does this connect to other parts of the system?
7. What would I need to explain to someone inheriting this code?
```

## Quality Assurance Through Understanding

### The "Rubber Duck Plus" Method
```
Before committing code, explain it to the AI as if the AI knows nothing:

"I'm going to walk through this code line by line and explain:
- What each section does and why
- What assumptions I'm making
- What could go wrong and how I've handled it
- How this fits into the larger system
- What I'd change if requirements evolved

Stop me when something doesn't make sense or when I'm glossing over complexity."
```

### The "Future Self" Exercise
```
Write documentation and comments as if explaining to yourself in 6 months:

"Help me write comments and documentation that assume:
- I won't remember the context of why I made these decisions
- The business requirements may have changed
- Someone else might need to modify this code
- The external dependencies might have evolved
- New team members need to understand the reasoning"
```

## Measuring Understanding vs. Implementation

### Competence Indicators
Track these metrics to ensure learning is happening:

**Understanding Metrics:**
- Can explain the "why" behind implementation choices
- Can predict failure modes and edge cases
- Can suggest alternative approaches and their tradeoffs
- Can debug issues by reasoning about the system
- Can explain how changes would ripple through the system

**Implementation Metrics:**
- Code quality and maintainability
- Appropriate use of patterns and principles
- Effective error handling and logging
- Good test coverage and meaningful tests
- Clear documentation and comments

The goal is to see both metrics improving together, not just implementation speed.
