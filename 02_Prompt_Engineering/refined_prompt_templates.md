**Refined Structure:** `"[Subject] distilled to essential forms using [Palette Limitation] with [Negative Space Strategy] and [Focal Emphasis]"`

**Example:** "Still life distilled to essential forms using monochromatic charcoal gradients with expansive surrounding negative space and single-point lighting emphasis"

**When to Use:** Source image is cluttered or overly complex, needs clarity and focus

**Key Refinement:** Treats minimalism as distillation process rather than simple reduction

---

## Template 9: Expressive Emotional Interpretation
**Refined Structure:** `"[Subject] interpreted through [Mark-Making Style] with [Emotional Intensity] and [Color Psychology] choices"`

**Example:** "Child's portrait interpreted through loose gestural brushwork with gentle melancholy and muted earth-tone psychological choices"

**When to Use:** Source image needs emotional amplification or personal artistic expression

**Key Refinement:** Connects mark-making directly to emotional content and color psychology

---

## Template 10: Cultural/Historical Recontextualization
**Refined Structure:** `"[Subject] filtered through [Cultural Period] aesthetic with [Decorative Tradition] motifs and [Craftsmanship Style] finish"`

**Example:** "Modern smartphone filtered through Art Nouveau aesthetic with botanical border motifs and hand-enameled metalwork finish"

**When to Use:** Source image needs historical depth or cultural significance

**Key Refinement:** Treats cultural elements as aesthetic filters rather than surface decoration

---

## Usage Guidelines

### Template Selection Strategy
Ask yourself: "What single aspect of this image most needs transformation?" Your answer points to the appropriate template.

### Sequential Application Process
1. Apply one template completely
2. Evaluate the result as a finished piece
3. If additional refinement is needed, choose a different template that addresses the remaining weakness
4. Never combine templates in a single prompt

### Quality Anchors
Add these phrases to any template for technical excellence:
- "Professional photography quality"
- "Gallery-worthy execution" 
- "Master craftsman attention to detail"
- "Museum-quality rendering"

### Precision Techniques
Replace vague placeholders with specific terms:
- Instead of "[Lighting]" → "directional window light with soft shadows"
- Instead of "[Color Palette]" → "warm ochre and burnt sienna earth tones"
- Instead of "[Brushwork]" → "confident alla prima wet-on-wet technique"
